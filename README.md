Project:Reciples 

In this project, I will be creating a basic recipe website that aims to provide users with easy access to a collection of delicious recipes.

Skills Demonstrated:

HTML Markup: I will have designed and structured the website using HTML, creating a user-friendly interface that presents information in a clear and organized manner. The index page will offer a visually appealing layout with links that lead to individual recipe pages.
